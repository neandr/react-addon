vContacts  Project        Notes/Status                 2017-04-30


New/Added _________________________________

  -- Hamburger Menu acting as vContacts Main Menu for
      #1  add new contact
      #2  Import (VCF/LDIF) / Export (VCF) contacts
      #3  Delete contact 
      #4  Reset Database (remove all contacts)   #5 KnownProblem\
      #5  Open documentation pages (calls browser/FX)

  -- Lookup for Contacts with "{firstName}{space}{lastName}"
          Looks up while typing; entering a {space} will direct the next entry for {lastName}
  -- Lookup for Contacts with "Category/Tags"
          A list of "Categories/Tags" is build from contacts of db
  -- Display source notation of selected contact (Shift Alt cursor)


Missing Points _____________________________

    #1  Contact Header in edit mode incomplete, current focus was on layout
    #2  Tags on Contact Header not editable (buttons [+] and [-] not active)
    #3  Status/error display on first line should work differently / at other place
    #4  Mailto only with one contact (just uses mail adr of selected contact)
         --> should support multiple contact selection with first mail adr of contact
    #5  Delete contacts needs multiple selection
    #6  Tag contacts with multiple selection 
    #7  Set 'preferred' attribute for email, tel(?), ..
    #8  Adding a new contact should directly open as a contact
    #9 


Known Problems _____________________________
   #1  On sidebar only max. 100 contacts shown (needs scrolling )
   #2  Chat not parsed -- which vCard element (RFC: IMPP ?)
   #3  Export without category generates vCard with empty category ==> Ben's concept?
   #4  Notes are not shown completely with multiple lines
   #5  Status/error display on first line not updated always correctly
