vContacts  Project        Notes/Status                 2017-09-29

Current Status ____________________________

  * Mailto supported for multiple selected contacts with To, Cc, Bcc. Also
    copying the collected mail addresses to the clipboard

  * Change order of contact property values (for email, phone, webpage etc) so
    the first entry can be used as the preferred one. That way the user can
    select contacts on the sidebar and mailto that collection of contacts
    with the preferred/first entry.

  * Status/Error msgs displayed in sidebar header, msgs is truncated but
    linked to show full details


  Other changes/updates ________________
  - Styles changed to use CSS/className definitions

  Code Cleaning with Atom/ESlint

  * Adding tags/categories on the contact edit failed if the contact had none
    or only one tag.


vContacts  Project        Notes/Status                 2017-06-15

Current Status ____________________________
  vContact now supports the following vCard properties for:
  -- Contact : Email, Phone, Address, Webpage, Chat (see below)
  -- Personal: name (n, fn), nickname, birthday, anniversary, gender, revision,
               note, categories/tag

  * Contacts can be defined via forms, file import with vcard (vcf) format or
    LDIF (as exported with classic TB/AB).
    Single or selected contacts can be exported with vcf format.

  Search for contact with family and/or given name.

  * Contact categories/tags are used instead of multiple sub-ab-books (or also
    called Lists (as with classic TB/AB). Categories/tags are used to 'group'
    contacts like this:
    --> Personal, Project, Friend, etc
  * Each contact can hold multiple tags so it can belong to different groups.
    With a filter function all members of a contact group are shown.
    Categories/Tags can be added, edited, removed.

  * Delete a selected contact (see below for multiple delete)
  * Add a personal picture (jpg, png or url/link) for a contact

  * A Hamburger/Slider Menu is used for some non frequent tasks like
    import/export and supports database reset (which will remove all contacts
    for new start). The menu also has some menu items to open documentation
    about the project


Refactoring vContacts _____________________
  * The data structure of the initial project was unnecessarily complex, so
    it was changed / kiss'd.


Known problems ____________________________
  -- [+] New Contact --> opens last known contact
  -- Status Line (on Sidebar header) not very well updated; with some
     error situations the sidebar and contact display are 'corrupt'
  -- vCard with url link are supported, but a missing link (err404) will
     show a blank 'pic' --> should show the default icon
  -- Export vcards with items (eg. gender, nickname) will write only the detail name

  -- Sidebar only shows max. of 100 contacts (performance issue)
      --> change sidebar with solution as Ben proposed

  ** Note **
  -- React updates the UI with setState, due to the async character
     changes at the UI may not show up directly
     --> see https://medium.com/@mweststrate/3-reasons-why-i-stopped-using-react-setstate-ab73fc67a42e
     ==> TODO


Next Steps ________________________________
  Sidebar Contact Display
    Current version is limited to display max of 100 contacts on the sidebar.
    This is due to performance constraints.
    Ben Bucksch has a possible solution for that, worth to test it.
    (http://benbucksch.github.io/trex/fastlist-test.html)

  Maintain a standard set of Categories/Tags, possibly part of 'Preference'

  vContacts running also outside of TB

  Integration with TB add contact from emails and more ...



generateVCF _______________________________
     (A python program, see https://github.com/neandr/vContacts)

  Generates random VCF addresses for test purpose and writes to an output file.
  Uses German based names, locations, generates tel/communication and mail
  entries, gender, birthday/anniversary dates.
  Each vCard has also a rev code and UUID

  -- some minor problems solved
  ==> It's recommend to regenerate random vcf cards and remove previous ones

New/Added _________________________________

  -- Hamburger Menu acting as vContacts Main Menu for
      #1  add new contact
      #2  Import (VCF/LDIF) / Export (VCF) contacts
      #3  Delete contact
      #4  Reset Database (remove all contacts)
      #5  Open documentation pages (calls browser/FX)

  -- Lookup for Contacts with "{firstName}{space}{lastName}"
          Looks up while typing; entering a {space} will direct the next entry for {lastName}
  -- Lookup for Contacts with "Category/Tags"
          A list of "Categories/Tags" is build from contacts of db
  -- Display source notation of selected contact (Shift Alt cursor)


Missing Points _____________________________
'X'  means solved

X    #1  Contact Header in edit mode incomplete, current focus was on layout
X    #2  Tags on Contact Header not editable (buttons [+] and [-] not active)
X    #3  Status/error display on first line should work differently / at other place
    #4  Mailto only with one contact (just uses mail adr of selected contact)
         --> should support multiple contact selection with first mail adr of contact
    #5  Delete contacts needs multiple selection
    #6  Tag contacts with multiple selection
    #7  Set 'preferred' attribute for email, tel(?), ..
    #8  Adding a new contact should directly open as a contact
         --> TODO currently opens the previous last contact, not the added
    #9


Known Problems _____________________________
'X'  means solved

   #1  On sidebar only max. 100 contacts shown (needs scrolling )
   #2  Chat not parsed -- which vCard element (RFC: IMPP ?)
   #3  Export without category generates vCard with empty category
        --> for category/tag solved, but is with gender, nickname
X   #4  Notes are not shown completely with multiple lines
   #5  Status/error display on first line not updated always correctly

Bugs _______________________________________
