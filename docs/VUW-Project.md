## Thunderbird vContacts <small> -- Project at VUW, New Zealand </small>  


__Thunderbird vContacts__, was started in 2016 as a project of SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING AND COMPUTER SCIENCE/Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand.
The project was aimed to build a addressbook based on industry standards, using modern technologies and to replace the current data store (mork).

The VUW realization was to build a Thunderbird add-on which is working locally (can be used in TB offline mode) with an underlying database (indexedDB), some interfacing to local files for importing/exporting of contacts and collections. The team decided to use REACT and modern HTML/JS/CSS techniques for the implementation.

Initial project details can be found [[on a GIT/Wikihere]](https://github.com/Thunderbird301/react-addon/wiki)
